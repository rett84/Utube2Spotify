                 <p>
                     I’m an Electrical and Software Engineer with a big passion
                     for new and exciting tech—especially anything to do with coding.
                     I enjoy programming as a hobby as well as a way to solve
                     real-world problems.
                     I have knowledge in C, C#, Python, BASH, SQL databases,
                     a little Javascript, as well as RT hardware systems.
                     At the moment I'm learning Blazor to expand my knowledge,
                     but I always have ideas and play with other technologies.
                 </p>
